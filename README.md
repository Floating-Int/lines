## Line counter
#### Instructions:

1. Add directory `lines` to `PATH` in `Enviroment variables`
2. Open a `command line` to change the `current working directory` to the one you wish to examine
2. Run `'lines'` to execute command

#### Flags:

* `-f` `--fast` skips display animations
* `-i` `--ignore-blank` ignores blank lines (`\n`)
